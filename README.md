We are a team of engineering students at the University of California, San Diego, competing in the IEEE California Annual MicroMouse competition (CAMM)

## What is CAMM
The CAMM or MicroMouse competition is an annual competition where students have to build a small maze-solving robot entirely from scratch. More information on the competition: [TODO LINK](https://)
